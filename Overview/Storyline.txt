***Overview

***The Meeting and Fetival
While intense negotiations are going on behind closed doors, a lively festival of all races takes place outside. Numerous stalls are et up, each merchant trying to outdo the others with lavish items and trinkets. Off to the side there are a few stalls with magical items, their prices excorbitant, most shy away from them. Dragonborne, gnomes, humans, and dwarves all mill about watching the festivities and purchasing things they definitly need. When certain Dragonborne collide with down-on-their luck human thugs, words are exchanged and tempers rise. A small scuffle will break out that could decide whether peace is maintainable in between the nations.

***The Rat Revolution
The rats have lived for too long under the thumb of the humans and dragonborne. They now have studied how each society came together and are doing a similar thing and demand to be soveriegn. They have gained the boldness Melvin have made him their first choice for a representative. They kidnap Shiku to show they not only mean buisness but as collateral for a time. They apporach Luna with an offer to meet nature if she helps convince everyone else in song.
