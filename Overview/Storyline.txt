***The Meeting and Fetival
While intense negotiations are going on behind closed doors, a lively festival of all races takes place outside. Numerous stalls are et up, each merchant trying to outdo the others with lavish items and trinkets. Off to the side there are a few stalls with magical items, their prices excorbitant, most shy away from them. Dragonborne, gnomes, humans, and dwarves all mill about watching the festivities and purchasing things they definitly need. When certain Dragonborne collide with down-on-their luck human thugs, words are exchanged and tempers rise. A small scuffle will break out that could decide whether peace is maintainable in between the nations.

***The Debate
The rats, Humans, and Dragonborne all meet to decide the fate of Kulu, the rats are fine with leaving but need a place to live and protection from the elements, no suitible land is near the humans. It is decided that a party will be tasked with finding the rat's new homeland and gathering the resources. The party will need to go into the Forest of Whispers, an eternally foggy forest that needs taming, no one knows what beasts could be lurking within it.
