***The Meeting and Fetival
While intense negotiations are going on behind closed doors, a lively festival of all races takes place outside. Numerous stalls are et up, each merchant trying to outdo the others with lavish items and trinkets. Off to the side there are a few stalls with magical items, their prices excorbitant, most shy away from them. Dragonborne, gnomes, humans, and dwarves all mill about watching the festivities and purchasing things they definitly need. When certain Dragonborne collide with down-on-their luck human thugs, words are exchanged and tempers rise. A small scuffle will break out that could decide whether peace is maintainable in between the nations.

They have chosen Melvin(The bread-bringer) as their representative and defender and accept Reggie as one of their own.
