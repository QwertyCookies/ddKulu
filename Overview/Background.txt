***World History
The Continent of Kulu is a large and mostly tropical area with large uncharted deep forests filled with mysterious beings. Magic in this land seeps from the ground and through the air. It permeates all space through sciences many seek to understand. In the center of the Kulu there is a large range of volcanoes where most of dragonborne reside. Humans are scattered in ruff alliances around mostly the outer rim of the continent as smaller fishing villages, they have finally united as the United Kulu Alliance. They have also begun to go farther inward in the search for resources and land. The dragonborne have grown annoyed at these fleshed one's creeping closer to their villages. The dragon born have finally been fully united by Ashko _____(Maya's character's last name), a powerful dragon sorcerer. They have come to call themselves, the Order of the Enflamed. The dragonborne have come to be more aggressive as the Kulu alliance seeps more inward on their ancestral lands. The prospect of war looms near if peace cannot be negotiated in the coming months.
