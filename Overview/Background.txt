The Continent of Kulu is a large and mostly tropical area with large uncharted deep forests filled with mysterious beings. Magic in this land seeps from the ground and through the air. It permeates all space through sciences many seek to understand. In the center of the Kulu there is a large range of volcanoes where most of dragonborne reside. Humans are scattered in ruff alliances around mostly the outer rim of the continent as smaller fishing villages, they have united under the Banner called the Kulu Alliance. The dragonborne have been a fairly separated people due to their hot tempers and tendency for desctruction. Each dragonborne town is usually on separate volcanoes with different cultures but still a deep respect and maintain the traditions of the ancient ones. Over time, the Kulu Alliance hasbegun to set up trade posts and small colonial towns farther inland. The dragonborne grow restless because of these fleshed invaders and want them to go back to the coast. Hesho _____(Fill in Maya's character's last name) has just brought the dragoborne villages together under the newfound "Order of the Enflamed". The possibility of war looms near if political relief doesn't come soon.
