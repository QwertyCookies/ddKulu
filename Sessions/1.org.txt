Trellis hears about many merchants coming to HuayHuay and decides to try and steal from them, Keira Gorum is dragged along by her father, Ashko Gorum to this festival. Luna Shimri and her band members perform at the festival. Trellis made an unsuccessful attempt to look for magic in one shop. Keira had a strange musical performance and flipped off the stage and ran into Shiku, a red dragonborne diplomat. She unsuccessfully flirted with him and Luna came to help her up but she rejected her help. Once Luna got on stage she called out Keira for being mean and then Keira jumped on stage and let out a bolt of lightning and flipped off again. Luna's performance went smoothly. Keira once again ran into Shiku again and failed at flirting and was kind of rude, Trellis chose this moment to steal from Shiku and took some legal documents. Then trellis folded them into an airplane and threw them at Keira. Keira caught them and read them, then went to expose them to her father and others in a meeting.
