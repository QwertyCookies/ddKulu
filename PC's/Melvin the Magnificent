***Melvin the Magnificient
**Wild Magic Forest Gnome Sorcerer
**Backstory
As a younger gnome of the forest I spent most of my days in the forest connecting with the magic but it never came naturally to me. But then one day, I walked out of the forest drawn by a mysterious force and I waded out deep into the water. Gnomes can't swim and I'm no different. I felt terrified but in that moment I was calm as the sea itself. It was in that moment I connected with the Way of the Water. That is how I became a wild mage. I now spend my days wandering near the ocean and built a little shack for my collections
