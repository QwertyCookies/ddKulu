**Backstory(Reverse Tarzan)
I was found in a gutter in Huayhuay, Owoka took me in as her own after she had a miscarrige. She's loved me like a daughter she never had. I love playing music with my friends as a past time and a career. Owoka taught me magic through song and dance. I now have a desire to find my inner sloth and discover more about my own kind.

**Motivations
Laying music with friends/family
Want to find family and other sloths

**Friends and Allies
Filbur - Spoons
Owoka - Fiddle 
Kuwey - Cowbell
