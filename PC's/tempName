**Backstory
I was born with a natural affinity to nature even though my draconic roots have disdain for that. I come from one of the larger Dragonborne Clans of the Blue dragon. I spend most of my time further down the mountian in the forest connecting with nature. My father always had a way with people and help form the Order of the Enflamed and now drags me to most of their meetings.
