**Backstory
I was born of Wilber and Lulakin, my father was a brash and brutish human and my mother was a elegant and fair elf. I became neither. When my mother wanted to return home she wanted to take me with her but my father forbade it he demanded I only learn the ways of humans. This drove me to run far away to all corners of the world and learn all I can I spend most of my days sly talking anyone susceptable to my charm, which is many.
